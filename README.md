# Conic (Programming Language)

## What is it?

Well... it's a programming language! I don't know much about
what I'm gonna do with it, and it's mainly just practice for
me to prepare to make a real programming language to be used
on the Carbonado blockchain. Maybe, by some strange turn of
events, Conic will be the official language of the Carbonado
blockchain! It all depends on how much actually gets done
with this project.

## Is it worth contributing to?

As I said, there's a possibility that Conic will be the
language used in the Carbonado blockchain, so feel free
to search the interpreter's code for security vulnerabilities.
Then again, I might just write a JS framework if the language
isn't well developed. You should only dedicate your time to
helping this project if you like the project itself, NOT only
if you like the Carbonado project. I don't really want to waste
anyone's time here.
