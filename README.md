## What is it for?

Alright, I changed my mind. Conic WILL BE THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE
OF THE CARBONADO BLOCKCHAIN! Originally, I wasn't sure if this
was a good idea, but it seems promising. If you want to add on
to the Carbonado project, and you like smart contracts, then Conic
is probably gonna be your favorite part of it.

## Contributing

Pull requests for parsing, or language specifications like
scope rules, garbage collection, etc. are accepted, but pull
requests related to changing any of the current syntax of
the language will likely be closed.
